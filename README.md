# Javascript Fundamentals: Phase One

----

## Objective

A series of exercises to help me learn the following:

* [x] To run JavaScript in the `node` REPL.
* [x] To run JavaScript files
* [x] To declare variables and print them in JavaScript using `console.log`
* [x] To declare and call JavaScript functions.
* [x] To use conditional statements (`if`/`else`)
* [x] To use loops sush as `while` and `for`
* [x] To use functions as values, and as arguments for other functions
* [x] To explain and use callback functions
* [x] To use arrays: performing basic operations on arrays
* [x] To declare and use JavaScript objects: in Javascript it usually refers to key-value pairs structure.
* [x] To learn `filter` and `map` arrays
* [x] To declare and use classes


## How to run it

1. Make sure to have `NVM` - the Node Version Manager installed, so we can use it to install a program called Node.js("node"). **Node** is a Javascript runtime - it reads JavaScript code and execute it as a program.
installation instructions for `NVM` in [this link here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

2. Install Node using the command line:

```bash
nvm install node
nvm use node
```

3. You can then type `node` in the command line, to launch the node REPL:

```bash
node
```

or run Javascript files with `.js` extension directly by calling the file name with the `node` keyword. 

For example, to run sayHello.js file, make sure you are inside the directory `04-functions` before typing the following below in the command line:

```bash
node sayHello.js
```
